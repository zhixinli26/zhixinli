I am a PhD student at the [Syracuse University School of Information Studies](https://ischool.syr.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Jaime Banks](https://ischool.syr.edu/jaime-banks/#Biography). I study how humans, espcially young minds, perceive mental capacities, moral patiency, relationality in social machines (e.g., voice assistants, chatbots, and social robots), and how their perceptions shape the way they interact with machines and humans. I am currently working under a National Science Foundation funded project (PI: Dr. Jaime Banks, Co-PI: Dr. Caleb T. Carr) to study how we perceive AI companions.
