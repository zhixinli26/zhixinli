I am a PhD student at [Syracuse University School of Information Studies](https://ischool.syr.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Jaime Banks](https://ischool.syr.edu/jaime-banks/#Biography). I STUDY the artificiality aspect of emergent social technologies (e.g., voice assistants, chatbots, and social robots) and I CARE about how humans, especially young minds, perceive this artificiality in AI when they interact with these entities.
