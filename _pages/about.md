I am an incoming PhD student at [Syracuse University School of Information Studies](https://ischool.syr.edu/) in Fall 2024. I will be advised by [Dr. Jaime Banks](https://ischool.syr.edu/jaime-banks/#Biography). I hold a Master's degree at [Marsal Family School of Education at the University of Michigan](https://marsal.umich.edu/) where I am currently being advised by [Dr. Ying Xu](https://ying-xu.com/). I am always eager to learn children's minds and behaviors when interacting with conversational agents. I apply theoretical frameworks and methodologies from cognitive psychology, human-computer interaction, and communication to examine how children socially and critically think about conversational AI.
